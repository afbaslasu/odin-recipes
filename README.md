# odin-recipes
Build a basic recipe website

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

//The website is build with HTML & will be revisited in future to style with with CSS.

Skills required of me for this project:

-Creation of a repo on GitHub called "odin-recipes"
-Cloning of "odin-recipes" in repos folder on my local machine
-Setting up of README.md file -- this particular stage, where I open up
 README.md file to write this "brief introduction."
-Use git status, git add, git commit and git push origin main
